# HuaRongDao-AI
This project is done totally by myself by using python 3.0 with a* and my own advanced heuristic.

The ouptout of this ai is a board which each number in the state represent a block.

The specific rule for this game you can refer:
[https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/華容道_(遊戲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski)

You can run my progamme by typing "python3 hrd.py (input file) (DFS output file) (A* output file)".
